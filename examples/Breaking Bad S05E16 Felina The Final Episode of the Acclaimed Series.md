Breaking Bad S05E16 Felina is not only the finale of the series, but also the third part of a trilogy that began with the penultimate episode "Ozymandias" and continued with the antepenultimate episode "Granite State". These three episodes depict the downfall of Walter White and his transformation from a family man to a ruthless criminal.
 
In "Ozymandias", Walter loses everything he cared about: his money, his family, his partner Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), and his brother-in-law Hank Schrader (Dean Norris), who is killed by a neo-Nazi gang led by Jack Welker (Michael Bowen). In "Granite State", Walter goes into hiding in a remote cabin in New Hampshire, where he is isolated and dying from cancer. In "Felina", Walter returns to New Mexico to settle his scores and tie up the loose ends.
 
The title of the episode, "Felina", has multiple meanings. It is an anagram of "finale", indicating that it is the last episode of the series. It is also a reference to the song "El Paso" by Marty Robbins, which plays in the opening scene and tells the story of a cowboy who returns to his lover Felina and dies in her arms. The song parallels Walter's journey and fate. Additionally, "Felina" can be interpreted as a chemical formula: Fe (iron), Li (lithium), and Na (sodium), which are elements that are related to blood, methamphetamine, and tears, respectively.
 
The episode features many callbacks and references to previous episodes and seasons, such as Walter's ricin capsule, his M60 machine gun, his car keys hidden in the sun visor, his watch given by Jesse, his lottery ticket with the coordinates of Hank's grave, his phone call to Skyler (Anna Gunn) using the same words he used in the pilot episode, his visit to Gretchen (Jessica Hecht) and Elliott (Adam Godley), his confession to Skyler that he did everything for himself, his farewell to Holly and Flynn (RJ Mitte), his rescue of Jesse from Jack's compound, his final confrontation with Jack and Todd (Jesse Plemons), his death in the meth lab surrounded by his "blue sky" product, and his theme song "Baby Blue" by Badfinger playing in the end credits.
 
Breaking Bad S05E16 Felina is a brilliant and satisfying conclusion to one of the greatest TV shows ever made. It showcases the superb writing, directing, acting, cinematography, music, and editing that made Breaking Bad a masterpiece of storytelling. It also delivers a powerful message about the consequences of one's choices and actions, and the moral ambiguity of human nature. Breaking Bad S05E16 Felina is a must-watch for any fan of quality television.
